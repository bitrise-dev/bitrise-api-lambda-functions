# Bitrise API + AWS Lambda Functions

In this series of articles, we shared some hands-on experience on how to use the** AWS Lambda**, learn to design and build a Serverless function to trigger Bitrise builds with **Bitrise API** via the custom Lambda function.

## The solution
As we know AWS Lambda function needs to be triggered by any supported triggers. Because of this, we will use **Alexa** and **Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) **to trigger the function. Inside the function, we will add our logic to receive the voice command from Alexa and pass it to Bitrise API using the POST endpoint to trigger a new build in our Bitrise app. Then, we will get the response from Lambda to the Alexa as a JSON output.

### Pre-Requisites: 

- [AWS Free Tier account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)
- IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure it with your AWS Account
- An [Amazon developer account](http://developer.amazon.com/): If you already have an Amazon.com account, but not an Amazon developer account, you have the option to use your Amazon.com account as a developer account.
- Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface [(ASK CLI)](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html): A tool for you to manage your Alexa skills and related resources, such as AWS Lambda functions.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [AWS IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
 
### How to use this repository
- Clone the repository
- Inside the project, run the following command `npm install`
- We need to zip the project to be able to upload it to the AWS Lambda function by the following command (Donâ€™t worry about the API Key and App Slug because we can use Lambda Environment variables to replace the hardcoded values) 

`zip -r LambdaBitrise.zip index.js node_modules` 

![upload](/images/upload.png)

- In Lambda function, click on the **Configuration** tab to add the Environment variables: 
  - APP_SLUG
  - API_KEY

![upload](/images/config.png)

- You can replace the **app_slug** and **API_Key** with the Lambda Environment variables:

 - ${process.env.APP_SLUG}
 - ${process.env.Api_KEY}
