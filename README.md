# Bitrise API + AWS Lambda Functions

In this series of articles, we shared some hands-on experience on how to use the AWS Lambda, learn to design and build a Serverless function to trigger Bitrise builds with Bitrise API via the custom Lambda function.

## The solution
As we know AWS Lambda function needs to be triggered by any supported triggers. Because of this, we will use Alexa and Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) to trigger the function. Inside the function, we will add our logic to receive the voice command from Alexa and pass it to Bitrise API using the POST endpoint to trigger a new build in our Bitrise app. Then, we will get the response from Lambda to the Alexa as a JSON output.

### Pre-Requisites: 

[AWS Free Tier account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)
IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure it with your AWS Account



`npm install`

We need to zip the project to be able to upload it to the AWS Lambda function by the following command (Donâ€™t worry about the API Key and App Slug because we can use Lambda Environment variables to replace the hardcoded values) 

`zip -r LambdaBitrise.zip index.js node_modules`

Click on the Configuration tab to add the Environment variables: 
- APP_SLUG
- API_KEY
